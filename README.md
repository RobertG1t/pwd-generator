Random Password Generator

This is a Python program that generates random passwords of a user-specified length and complexity. The user can specify the length of the password and the character sets to include in the password (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols). The program then generates a random password that satisfies the specified criteria and saves it to a text file in the same directory as the program.

Usage:

To use the program, simply run the password_generator.py file in a Python environment. The program will prompt you to enter the desired password length and complexity. For the complexity, you can enter a string containing one or more of the following options:
    l: lowercase letters
    u: uppercase letters
    d: digits
    s: symbols

The program will then generate a random password that satisfies the specified criteria and save it to a file named passwords.txt in the same directory as the program. The program will also display the generated password and the absolute path of the file where the password was saved.
